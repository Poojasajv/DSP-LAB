1. Unit Impulse Signal:
 A signal that is zero everywhere except at one point, typically at t=0 where its value is 1.

2. Bipolar Pulse Signal:
 A pulse signal that alternates between positive and negative values, usually
rectangular in shape. It switches between two constant levels (e.g., -1 and 1) for a
defined duration.
 Mathematically p(t) = A for |t| ≤ τ/2, p(t) = 0 otherwise

3. Unipolar Pulse Signal:
 A pulse signal that alternates between zero and a positive value. It remains at zero for
a specified duration and then jumps to a positive constant level (e.g., 0 and 1).
 Mathematically p(t) = A for |t| ≤ τ/2, p(t) = 0 otherwise (assuming A is positive)

4. Ramp Signal:
 A signal that increases linearly with time.
 Mathematically r(t) ={ 𝒕; 𝒕 ≥ 𝟎}
𝟎; 𝒕 < 𝟎

5. Triangular Signal:
 A periodic signal that forms a triangle shape, linearly increasing and decreasing with
time, typically between a positive and negative peak.
 Mathematically: Λ(t) = 1 - |t| for |t| ≤ 1, Λ(t) = 0 otherwise

    6. Sine Signal:
 A continuous periodic signal. It oscillates smoothly between -1 and 1.
 Mathematically: y(t)=Asin(2πft)

7. Cosine Signal:
 A continuous periodic signal like the sine wave but phase-shifted by π\2.
 Mathematically: y(t)=Acos(2πft)

8. Exponential Signal:
 A signal that increases or decreases exponentially with time. The rate of growth or
decay is determined by the constant a
 Mathematically: e^(at)

9. Unit Step Signal:
 A signal that is zero for all negative time values and one for positive time values.
