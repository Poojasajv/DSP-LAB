Circular convolution is a mathematical operation that is like linear convolution but is performed
in a periodic or circular manner. This is particularly useful in discrete-time signal processing
where signals are often represented as periodic sequences.
Mathematical Definition:
Given two periodic sequences x[n] and h[n], their circular convolution is defined as:
y[n] = (x[n] ⊛ h[n]) = ∑_{k=0} ^{N-1} x[k]h[(n-k) mod N]

Applications:
 Discrete-Time Filtering: Circular convolution is used for filtering discrete-time signals.
 Digital Signal Processing: It's a fundamental operation in many digital signal
processing algorithms.
 Cyclic Convolution: In certain applications, such as cyclic prefix OFDM, circular
convolution is used to simplify the implementation of linear convolution.
